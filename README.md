#### Speaker Notes

The speakers notes are with the slides in the pdf above.

The talking in the physical presentation happened in French, and so the speaker notes are in french too.

I have a hard time improvising in French when talking about something technical, and so my speaker notes are more of a not too perfect transcript of the things I wanted to say.
